# Campaign Stop

Campaign stop is a knowledge base for non-career politicians to jump-start their first campaign

# How to Use

* Install ruby
* `gem install jekyll`
* `gem install gemspec`
* `jekyll serve`

# What's the stack?

This is just a plain and simple jekyll blog modified to contain the instructions
for running a campaign. We split up the instructions and resources into separate
sections in the `_posts` directory. If you know markdown, that should be enough
to be able to contribute.

# Added Features

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Use `_config.yml` to **set whether the homepage tiles should pull pages or posts**, as well as how many to display.
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
* Set **featured images** in front matter.

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
