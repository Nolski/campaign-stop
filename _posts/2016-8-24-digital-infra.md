A key component for allowing any candidate who can hope to compete and possibly
be selected for public office is to have a space on the web that you can point
to when people want to learn more about your public stance, background, and
most importantly *how to volunteer to help*.

## Building your own Website

#### Rolling your own

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/website_template.png" alt="website template" /></span>
Luckily in the modern age, there are plenty of tools out there to help get you
set up with a shiny new website. If you are really lean on money and have a tiny
bit of html/css knowledge, templates such as [phantom](https://html5up.net/phantom)
from https://html5up.net are great places to start with creating your own static
website.

If your website is just static webpages, Github offers free hosting through their
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) platform and deploying is as easy as 
pushing your website files to github. You will of course need a domain name for
your website. [Name Cheap](https://namecheap.com) is a popular and easy to use
service to buy and set up domain names.

Lastly, you'll need to point your new domain name at your website. Luckily,
Github has already provided a [tutorial for doing so](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

#### Using a service to build a website

If you have no technical expertise, [Square Space](https://squarespace.com/) is
a great and fairly low cost place where non-programmers can create their own
website through an easy to use user interface. Templates such as [Harris](https://www.squarespace.com/templates?category=community-and-non-profit&template=harris)
make a great starting point to begin to build out your website. Square Space
also offers their own service to [buy domains](https://www.squarespace.com/domain-name-search/)
which makes it very easy to hook up your own website.

#### Field The Bern
<span class="image left" ><video style="height:320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fieldthebern.mp4" autoplay></video></span>

FieldTheBern was an open source app that helps you go door to door and canvass
for Bernie Sanders. Since it is open source it can easily be modified to use for
your own campaign Knock on doors, tell people about your candidate, find out
their level of interest. Next to phonebanking, canvassing is probably the second
most crucial and effective way to get votes. The app allows volunteers to enter
data about the visit. 

For example: if no one was home, or the resident strongly
supports your candidate, and if they have been contacted before, or want to be
contacted again. A map shows pins for houses that have already been visited so
that other volunteers don't overlap each other. The app also supports
integration for including information about your candidate (cached for offline)
as well as primary and caucus dates and info for all 50 states. Canvassers can
also track progress and score points and compete with other volunteers.
