Having a good ground game on election day is key to getting elected. All of the
work that you have put in up until this point doesn't matter if you can't
mobilize people to get out and vote. Luckily, with recent elections, a large
amount of open source tools have been built for this specific purpose.

## Mobilization Tools

#### Calling Voters

Especially with local elections, the size of your voter base that you need to
mobilize is fairly small. So if you have done your work and research before
hand, you will have been able to target the necessary demographics you need to
mobilize in order to get elected.

[Coders For Sanders](https://coders.forsanders.com/) has created a tool to help
utilize your volunteer base by setting up call lists and easily dialing
potential voters and convince them to go out and vote (and bring friends!).

#### Driving Voters

Not all voters (especially low income voters) have easy access 

## Voter Regulations

Your campaign doesn't end once the votes are counted. You'll want to familiarize
yourself with your states regulations around voting. It doesn't happen often but
you'll want to make sure you are prepared to review things such as regulations
around **performing a recount**, **protesting**, and most importantly **voting
requirements**.
