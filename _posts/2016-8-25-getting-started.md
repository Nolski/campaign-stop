So you’ve decided you want to run for public office - congratulations and good
luck! The initial phase of planning will determine the strength of your campaign
and ultimately your success on Election Day. This section will cover things to
plan for and getting your operation off the ground.

### Staff 

Selecting your staff will be the most important decisions of your planning
phase. Your staff should have expertise in specialities you are unable to do or
spare time to focus on. Most skeleton campaign staff will include the following:

**Campaign Manager** - The hub that connects all the pieces of your campaign
together. Campaign managers will help coordinate logistics, hire staff and and
advise strategy. The ideal campaign manager has deep operational experience and
familiarity with the jurisdiction you are running in.

**Finance Director** - Holds the purse strings to your campaign. Without a competent
finance director to plan fundraising, project a budget and filing disclosure
reports your campaign can find itself out of funds before election day. While
fundraising is ultimately up to the candidate, finance directors keep candidates
focused and efficient.

Prior campaign experience is helpful but not essential. The biggest indicator of
success for operatives are problem solving and persistence. Candidates with
state party backing will have access to a large network of experienced political
operatives. National organizations like [DCCC](http://dccc.org/),
[DSCC](http://www.dscc.org/), [NRCC](https://www.nrcc.org/) or [NSRC](nrsc.org)
will help place staff to appropriate districts.

### Budget

A successful campaign will have a carefully planned budget. Projecting
expenditures and fundraising carefully ensures enough funds to run a campaign
and execute a strategy through election day. Almost all campaign services
software offer fundraising management and accounting features to help you plan
your budget. See our opensource software for low cost or free solutions.

### Strategy

Setting a well thought out strategy from the beginning ensures you
aren’t wasting time, energy and money for a campaign destined to lose. The well
formulated strategy will consider votes needed to win, a platform that aligns
with the demographics you hope to win, and a messaging delivery strategy that
will connect with your target audience. New York public voter registration data
