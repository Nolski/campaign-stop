As mentioned in Getting Started part of your overall campaign strategy
should include a voter target to mobilize. Your outreach strategy will determine
how to connect to your target audience and let voters know a candidate is
running with ideas that resonate with them. All campaign service softwares have
self service tools to help you build call lists, create canvass routes and
manage volunteers. Depending on your strategy and needs, selecting the right
software will do most of the heavy lifting outside of your conversations with
voters.

## Canvassing

A district that is geographically friendly to canvassing will need volunteers or
staffers to knock doors and get your message out. A well rounded canvassing tool
will help plan routes, manage voter contacts and analyze your progress.
Softwares like [Polis](http://www.polisapp.com/) and [ecanvasser](https://www.ecanvasser.com/) are available.

## Phone Banking

Just as important to canvassing is your outreach by phone. Rural districts that
arenâ€™t friendly to efficient canvassing will have higher emphasis on their phone
banking efforts. As you get closer to election day and sundown gets earlier,
your canvassing hours will also become more limited. Phone banking ensures you
reach daytime professionals who you are unable to meet during canvassing.
